    "description" : "The assisted wide-grip chest dip (kneeling) is a variation of the chest dip exercise that targets the chest, triceps, and shoulders. The exercise is typically performed using a dip assist machine or by having a partner assist with resistance. To perform the exercise, kneel in front of the dip assist machine and grasp the handles with a wide grip. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your chest is near the handles, then press up to the starting position. Keep your body in a straight line and avoid swinging or using momentum to lift your body. The kneeling position allows for a more focused and isolated contraction in the chest muscles.",
    "dos": [
      "Keep your body in a straight line throughout the exercise to maintain proper form and engage the chest muscles.",
      "Use a wide grip to target the chest muscles more effectively.",
      "Lower your body slowly and with control to maximize muscle activation.",
      "Use an assist machine or have a partner provide resistance to help you perform the exercise with proper form.",
      "Keep your shoulders back and down to prevent injury"
    ],
    "dont": [
      "Do not swing or use momentum to lift your body, as this can take tension off the chest muscles and increase the risk of injury.",
      "Do not round your lower back or let your head drop forward as this can cause strain on the neck and lower back.",
      "Do not lock your elbows at the top of the movement as this can put stress on the joint.",
      "Don't hold your breath during the movement.",
      "Do not use too much weight as it may cause you to lose form and increase risk of injury."
